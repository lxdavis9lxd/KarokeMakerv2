# Feature Specification: MP3 to Karaoke File Converter

**Feature Branch**: `001-karaoke-converter`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a web app that will create a Karaoke File from a MP3. I need the output to be in a format that can be used by a Karaoke player, which means I need to see the lyric visually and the vocals are removed from the music."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user uploads an MP3 file to the web application, which automatically separates the vocals from the instrumental track, extracts or allows input of lyrics, synchronizes the lyrics with the audio timeline, and generates a complete karaoke package containing the instrumental audio file and synchronized lyrics file that can be used in standard karaoke players.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has an MP3 file with vocals, **When** they upload it to the application, **Then** the system processes it and provides a downloadable karaoke package
2. **Given** the processing is complete, **When** the user downloads the result, **Then** they receive both an instrumental audio file and a synchronized lyrics file (.lrc format)
3. **Given** the generated files, **When** loaded into a karaoke player, **Then** the lyrics display in sync with the instrumental music
4. **Given** a large MP3 file, **When** uploaded, **Then** the user sees real-time progress updates during processing
5. **Given** the vocal separation is complete, **When** the user previews the result, **Then** they can hear the instrumental track with significantly reduced vocals

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an MP3 file has no detectable vocals (instrumental-only tracks)?
- How does the system handle files with poor audio quality or heavy distortion? do not create output and show error on ui that file was not processed  310 error - poor audio quality 
- What occurs when automatic lyric extraction fails or produces inaccurate results? do not create output and show error on ui that file was not processed 311 - error extration failed
- How does the system manage extremely long audio files (30+ minutes)? do not create output and show error on ui that file was not processed 315 - error to long of a song 
- What happens when multiple users upload large files simultaneously? process one at a time   

## Requirements

- **FR-003**: System MUST extract or allow manual input of song lyrics
- **FR-004**: System MUST synchronize lyrics with audio timeline to create timestamped text
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate downloadable karaoke files in standard formats (.lrc for lyrics, audio file for instrumentals)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide real-time progress updates during audio processing
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to preview processed audio before final download
- **FR-008**: System MUST support lyrics display with visual highlighting synchronized to audio playback
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate uploaded files are valid MP3 format before processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide error messaging when processing fails or produces poor results

- **PR-003**: File uploads MUST support progress indicators and error recovery
- **PR-004**: Generated karaoke files MUST maintain audio quality suitable for karaoke use

### Quality Requirements
- **QR-001**: Vocal separation MUST produce instrumentals with significantly reduced vocal presence
- **QR-002**: Lyric synchronization MUST be accurate within acceptable timing tolerances  Â±0.5 seconds
- **QR-003**: Generated .lrc files MUST be compatible with standard karaoke players
- **QR-004**: Output audio quality MUST be suitable for karaoke performance use

### Key Entities
- **Audio File**: Uploaded MP3 containing original song with vocals and instrumentals
