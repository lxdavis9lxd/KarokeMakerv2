# KarokeMaker v2 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Mobile-First Responsive Design
All UI components must be designed mobile-first with responsive breakpoints; Every element must scale gracefully across devices (320px to 2560px+); Touch-friendly interfaces with minimum 44px touch targets; Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop

### II. Dynamic Content Management
Real-time data updates without page refresh; Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements; State management for dynamic user interactions; API-driven content delivery

### III. Performance Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Page load time under 3 seconds on 3G networks; First Contentful Paint under 1.5 seconds; Lighthouse performance score 90+; Bundle size optimization mandatory

### IV. Cross-Platform Compatibility
Support for all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge); iOS Safari and Android Chrome compatibility required; Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities; Fallbacks for older browser versions

### V. Accessibility & Standards
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum; Semantic HTML structure required; Keyboard navigation support; Screen reader compatibility; Color contrast ratio 4.5:1 minimum

### API Integration
RESTful API or GraphQL endpoint connectivity; Real-time updates via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events; Error handling and retry mechanisms; Loading states and offline fallbacks

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
ESLint and Prettier configuration enforced; Component testing with Jest or Vitest; E2E testing for critical user flows; Git hooks for pre-commit validation

### Deployment Pipeline
Automated build and deployment process; Environment-specific configuration management; HTTPS enforcement; CDN integration for static assets

## Governance

Constitution defines minimum viable product requirements; All features must pass mobile responsiveness tests; Performance budgets enforced in CI/CD pipeline; Regular accessibility audits mandatory
