- T037-T040 (Frontend Services) → T041-T044 (Application Pages)

### Parallel Execution Groups:
**Group A (Backend Services)**: T013-T017, T018-T021, T023-T025
**Group B (Frontend Components)**: T032-T036, T037-T040
**Group C (Testing)**: T045-T049 (after implementation phases)
**Group D (DevOps)**: T054-T058 (independent of core features)

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All core features have corresponding implementation tasks
- [x] Audio processing pipeline broken into manageable components
- [x] Frontend and backend tasks properly separated
- [x] Parallel tasks target different files/components
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] Dependencies clearly defined
- [x] Testing phase included for all major components
- [x] DevOps and deployment considerations included

## Notes
- Audio processing tasks (T018-T021) are CPU-intensive and may need Docker containers
- WebSocket integration (T026, T038) enables real-time progress updates
- File cleanup (T063) is critical for managing storage in production
- Performance testing (T049) should include load testing with multiple concurrent uploads
